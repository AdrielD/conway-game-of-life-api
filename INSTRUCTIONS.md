The following should be done in Ruby as the target framework.
Implement an API for Conway's Game of Life. Conway's Game of Life - Wikipedia

The API should have implementations for at least the following:
1. Allows uploading a new board state, returns id of board
2. Get next state for board, returns next state
3. Gets x number of states away for board
4. Gets final state for board. If board doesn't go to conclusion after x number of attempts,
returns error

The service you write should be able to restart/crash/etc... but retain the state of the boards.

Please make a simple UI that uses your backend API to display the board state. Thisdoesn't have to be very complex but should be enough to show off your React skills

The code you write should be production ready. You don’t need to implement any authentication/authorization. Be prepared to show how your code meets production-ready requirements.

This may take up to 4 – 5 hours to complete. Come prepared to talk about your architecture and coding decisions.
